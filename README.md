# FeloxGame

## What is this project?
- This is my first game project, building from a helpful GameEngine.TK project and the OpenTK learn documentation online.

## What am I trying to achieve?
- I'm using this to improve my programming experience...
- ...But I've been interested in procedural terrain generation for years.
- I would really very much like to get good at coding :)

## Are you actually learning to code through this?
Yes! Here is an ever expanding list of implemented concepts and general coding practices I have added to my game.

### __Coding Practices & Concepts__:
*recursion | enums | perlin noise | class inheritance | matrices | GLSL*
- **enums**: Finding opportunities to use them
- **File handling**: Loading appropriately and efficiently from files, using JSON, ImageSharp, etc.
- **Github**: Learning the essentials of Git and the programmer workflow.
- **GLSL (shaders)**: Understanding the fundamentals of what a GPU should do vs a CPU; using uniforms; changing shaders; setting active texture units; studying the graphics pipeline
- **Inheritance**: Added class inheritance in Inventory.cs and strengthened my understandings of `base`
- **Matrix manipulation**: Use and understanding of vectors and matrices to draw the world, player, and UI.
- **Namespaces**: Organising code into a structured system; Knowing when to group files, but also when not to
- **The `out` keyword**: Finding justification for this hitherto less used keyword in my Inventory.cs class
- **Procedural world generation**: Use of noise functions to generate an infinite world
- **Recursion**: I use recursive methods to update and draw my UI system 
- **Tree structures**: I have developed a tree structure to draw all UI objects within their parent objects

## How much time have you put into this project?
- I'm keeping an estimate of the different stages in learning to code. I'll get back to you on that.
